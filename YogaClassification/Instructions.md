## This repo consists of the notebooks and inference code used for the Yoga Classifier

### 'training' folder    
The folder has two notebooks-  
- YogaClassfication.ipynb which is the notebook used for training.Run this to reproduce the results.   
- Network_ReCreation_PyTorch.ipynb contains _(incomplete)_ experiments in restructuring of the PyTorch Code 
- Contains the _data_ folder which is actually just a dummy folder with very few images. The real data can be downloaded from [this](https://www.amarchenkova.com/2018/12/04/data-set-convolutional-neural-network-yoga-pose/) link.

### 'inference' folder
